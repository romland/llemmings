Give me a high-performance flood-fill for html canvas. Be concise. 
The, by far, most important thing is high performance. Look at 
super-fast C implementations and make it javascript. 

Note, though: Don't do unnecessary bitshifts to avoid division or
multiplication as the browser will easily optimize that itself.

Name it: floodFill(x, y, targetColor, fillColor, ctx)

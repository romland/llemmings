The following functions draws all drawn shapes on a canvas,
the second half of draw() draws a preview of a current shape being drawn by mouse
movement during mouse button being pressed.

Add a shape for Triangle too -- just give me the new code needed for (no need for full functions):
- existing shapes drawing
- preview shape
- shape done

<<< code for draw/finishDrawing here >>>

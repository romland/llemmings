#selectionDiv { ... }

Given the CSS for that, give me a minimal amount of javascript code to move that div
(already declared variable is called selectionDiv) with the mouse within the boundary
of a DOM element in the variable 'canvas'. Note that the canvas element can be at
an arbitrary position, so you need to use offsets (scroll too). The dragging-point (where
mouse goes down) should remain the same in relation to the div when the div is moved
with the mouse (don't make that dragging point 0,0).

Enclose all the functionality for this in a function called initSelectionDiv()

Give me only the code, no need for extra explanation.

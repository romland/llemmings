>>> Prompt: 
Given javascript and HTML canvas:

Give me code for an algorithm that generates what looks like highly detailed organic 
growth with small trees and roots of various sizes. The small trees should have leaves.

The trees should be placed along all edges of the canvas so that the trunk is always 
going inwards on the canvas.

It needs to be organically colored (not just monochrome), e.g. multiple shades of 
brown, green, yellow and red.

You can use e.g. Lindenmayer system for the trees (don't forget leaves). Figure something out for the
backgdrop.

Don't use any external dependencies.

Give me only code, no explanation.

>>> HUMAN NOTE:
I have massaged the code quite a bit and merged a few outcomes of variations of the above prompt.

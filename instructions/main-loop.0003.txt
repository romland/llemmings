Given javascript and the snippet requestAnimationFrame(update)
Give me code on how to throttle the update() function to a fixed FPS. Do
not add any new arguments to the update() function. 

Use high precision timer.
Declare and initialize all variables needed.

I don't need explanation this time, just give me the code.

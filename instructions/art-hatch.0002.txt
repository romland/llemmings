Given JS and canvas, I want an animation stored in an array 'frameImages'. Each
frame should be an image (new Image).

Two rectangles (doors) of 10 pixel height, simulating a hatch opening downwards,
like this:
Start position (closed):
 __
End position (open):
/  \

Note how only their angle changes, not position or size. Center of rotation is
left and right edge for left and right door respectively.

Go from start to end in 30 frames (but make configurable).
Wrap it in a function called 'generateAnimation', return 'frameImages'.

This time I don't need an explanation, just give me the code.

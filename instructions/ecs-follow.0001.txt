Given an ECS in JS.
I need "Follow" component and accompanying System. It would take another entity's 
id, component name and one or more attribute names. E.g. x and y of of e.g. a 
Position component.

The idea is that the attributes in the Follow component would take attributes from
the Followed Entity and apply it to its own components.

The Follow component should be declared this way:
    class Follow extends Component
    {
        constructor(entityId, componentName, attributes)
        {
            super();
            this.entityId = ...;
            ...
        }
    }

In systems, you get components like this:
for (const [id, pathFollowing] of Object.entries(components.Rotate)) { ... }

In systems, you get related components like this:
const position = components.Position[id];

The system's (FollowSystem) update should look like this: update(deltaTime, components)

This time, I don't need an explanation, just give me the code.

Given this partial game object:

    class Lemming {
      constructor(x, y) {
        this.id = -49152;
        this.width = 10;
        this.height = 20;
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.velX = 0;
        this.velY = 0;
      }
    }

and this structure in levelData:
    "finish": {
        "x": 750,
        "y": 480,
        "radius" : 100,
        "clear": true
    }

I want a function to check whether a lemming reached the finish area.
You can use manhattan distance.

In the update loop, check whether lemming reached its finish, if it was, 
increase score by one and set a new property in the lemming that it was
rescued.

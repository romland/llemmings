HUMAN NOTE: I think the result from this prompt was completely ditched and replaced with "Animation"

>>> Prompt:
Given an ECS in Javascript where following components are already available:
Velocity, Position, Sprite, PathFollower

and following Systems are already available:
MovementSystem, RenderingSystem

Get components like this:
for (const [id, pathFollowing] of Object.entries(components.PathFollowing)) { ... }

Get related components like this:
const position = components.Position[id];

Give me the component and System for transforming sprites (bitmaps) on a canvas.

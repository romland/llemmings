Given HTML canvas and javascript.

I want to be able to click on objects on the canvas, but the canvas might be resized 
with e.g. 'width: 100%' and repositioned (e.g. 'margin: 0 auto') using CSS so exact pixels will not work. 

Make it a function to convert the screen coordinate to a canvas coordinate.

This time, give me only the code, I don't need explanations.

This is a circle that represents a hand, right now it is static.

It should move in a curve back and forth as the object walks.
To determine animation state, you have this.age to use.

Note that:
- it should move smoothly back and forth so just using mod age
  is not enough as it needs to move back too

        ctx.fillStyle = "white";
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(
          this.x + this.width / 2,
          this.y + this.height / 2,
          2, // hand-size
          0, 2 * Math.PI
        );
        ctx.fill();

This time, just give me the code, no need for explanation.

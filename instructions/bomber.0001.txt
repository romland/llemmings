We are making a game with lemmings. A specific type of lemming is a Bomber. When a lemming is assigned to be a bomber,
it should stop moving and then blow up and create an random, organic looking hole at it's location -- the lemming will die from this. The hole
it leaves after should be carved out by clearing pixels in oldImgData.

A lemming looks like this:


Create a function that creates the hole.
I also need the logic to add to Lemming's update function.

I don't want pseudo-code, I want real code. And only code, no comments. If you need to create functions not declared
in the snippet I gave you, implement them and show them to me.

This took a while to get right, mostly due to what I believe is some Chrome
when we're generating the animation. Works in Firefox and Safari, but fails in
Chrome.

>>> Prompt:
In the same vein as the snippet below, I want a function that generates a frame of 
an animation that depicts a bubble popping. It should grow slowly and then 'explode'
in a pop where a few particles fly off it and then disappear (either through fading
or scaling). The bubble should not be filled.

The arguments to the function must remain the same and in the same order, infer anything
else (e.g. center is width/2, height/2, max-radius is hardcoded, etc). 

There seems to be a bug in Chrome with the arc() function, make sure radius is an int and does not
exceed the size of the canvas.

function drawHatch(context, width, height, currentFrameNum, totalFrameCount)
{
    // calculate angle of rotation for each door (Human: 1.34 is just because i want it slightly more than 90 degrees)
    const angle = (currentFrameNum / totalFrameCount * 1.34) * Math.PI / 2;

    context.save();
    context.translate(16, 5);
    context.rotate(angle);
    context.fillRect(0, -5, 30, 5);
    context.restore();

    context.save();
    context.translate(76, 5);
    context.scale(-1, 1);   // mirror
    context.rotate(angle);
    context.fillRect(0, -5, 30, 5);
    context.restore();
}

Feel free to use a global variable for the particles.

Using HTML canvas (I don't need the HTML, it already exists. Canvas ID is canvas).

Draw a sparkle on a canvas with configurable size, the spikes of the sparkle
should come out from the center, at random angle and random length.

To generate a spike, you first have to decide how thick the base will be, 
then place that base in the center of the sparkle. Then decide which angle
it should come out of the center from. The other end of the spike should obviously
be thinner than the base (1 pixel?). Do this for all sides of the sparkle.
I should be able to specify approximate length (but it they are somewhat random),
and size of the core and all over size of the sparkle.

This time I don't need an explanation, just give me the code. Be concise.

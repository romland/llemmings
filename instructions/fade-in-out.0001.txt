Given a canvas and requestAnimationFrame(update).

Give me functions to fade in and out HTML element "canvas" on command
from update(). The command is a global variable called "fade" which 
can contain "in", "out", or null.

You have the following timing variables available:
lastFrameUpdate = currentTime - (currentTime % frameInterval);

I don't need explanation this time, just give me the code.

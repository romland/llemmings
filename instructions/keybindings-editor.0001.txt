=====
Ignore:
- it's important that user is able to assign two keys-combinations for the same action
- To support multiple key-combinations for a single action, I picture a key-binding structure like this: { "select-next-creature" : [ "key-combo-1", "key-combo-2" ], ... }
=====

Given a game written in JavaScript.

I need a key-binding editor where I can view and set my keybindings. Make it so that I
can press a key-combo in an input box to set it rather than having to type in the key-combo.

Make sure:
- the key-combination is valid when using client events
- generate the HTML for the binds (e.g. name of the action and input field for setting the key for it)
- place the generated HTML in the element with ID "keybinding-editor"
- that when I press e.g. "shift+3" it does not generate a key-shortcut that says "shift+#", it should say "shift+3"
- it's not possible to assign more than one action to the same key (any other actions using that key should become unassigned)
- the key-combination is a plain key (a-z, 0-9) or a key in combination with shift/ctrl/cmd/alt
- to add buttons for reverting to default and save
- you cannot assign only a modifier key as a keybind
- to bind event-listeners only to the input field, not the entire window
- that it says "space" instead of " " for the spacebar key

The following keybinds are there by default (ID of the action to perform : key-combination(s)):
select-next-creature : tab
select-previous-creature : shift+tab
deselect-creature : space
restart-level : escape
toggle-pause : p 
apply-climber : 1 
apply-floater : 2

Load and save the bindings using local storage.

This time give me only the javascript code, I don't need any explanation.

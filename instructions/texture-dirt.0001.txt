>>> Prompt: 
How would you generate a playful, but realistic 2D dirt texture. Use only JavaScript 
and canvas, without external dependencies or images. The texture must fill the entire canvas.

Use raw pixel manipulation rather than canvas shape-drawing methods.

Don't use too bright colors.

Use the already implemented function PerlinNoise2D(x, y) for noise. There can be no other 
dependencies except a canvas element with id "canvas".

Give me the code. No need for additional explanation.

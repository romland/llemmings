Using client-side javascript and given this structure:

const defaultKeybinds = {
    "select-next-creature": "tab",
    "select-previous-creature": "shift+tab",
    "deselect-creature": "space",
    "restart-level": "escape",
    "toggle-pause": "alt+p",
    "apply-climber": "ctrl+1",
    "apply-floater": "cmd+2",
    'apply-bomber': "3",
    'apply-blocker': "4",
    'apply-builder': "5",
    'apply-basher': "6",
    'apply-miner': "7",
    'apply-digger': "8"
};

This structure is pairs of { action : key-combination, ... }.

Give me a function that will listen to key-event and when a matching key combination is pressed,
execute the appropriate function, that is, an action named 'select-next-creature' would have a 
function called selectNextCreature.

Note that "shift+tab" is not an actual valid key in an event. You would need to check
for the modifier shift and the actual key for tab.

The structure is dynamic, generate the name of the function we need to call dynamically.

You do not need to give me the functions for the actions, they already exist.

I don't need an explanation of the code this time.

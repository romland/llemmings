Give me either CSS/style or an SVG for the HTML element with ID "start-game".

The looks should be:
- wooden color (gradients?)
- avoid very bright and very dark colors
- darker when hovered over
- a bit of shadow
- a bit rounded

It should:
- have the text of it centered
- have cursor: pointer
- centered on screen, both on x and y (absolute position)
- for centering, also use local transform, e.g.: transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
- also add:
    font-family: "Henny Penny";
    font-size: 20px;
    font-weight: bold;

Give me only the CSS in a codeblock, no explanation needed this time.

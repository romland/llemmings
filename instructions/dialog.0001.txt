Using plain HTML and no dependencies.

Give me a very simple modal pop-over with a close icon in top-left corner.

The modal should be initialized with javascript, using e.g.:
openDialog(title, htmlContent)

It should also:
- center on the screen and be responsive (e.g. using max-width, min-width etc)

Only give me the code, I don't need an explanation this time.

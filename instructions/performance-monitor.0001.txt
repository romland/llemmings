>>> Prompt:
In javascript without 3rd party dependencies. Give me a reusable module for 
an arbitrary amount labels for measuring performance of code. It should output
the results to a div in HTML which the module should generate itself too

E.g. I want to be able to do:
perfMonitor.start("bkg-rest")
... arbitrary code I want to check performance of...
perfMonitor.end("bkg-rest")

It should add a minimum amount of overhead, showing of results will happen
continuously and very often. So the showing of results should be very efficient,
e.g. any HTML elements should have been created on initialization.

Be concise. This time I don't need an explanation, just give me the code.

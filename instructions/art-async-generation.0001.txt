In javascript, given an object:
bitmaps = { "foo": [ bitmapdata1a, bitmapdata1b, ...], "bar": bitmapdata2 }. 

I want to await on all bitmap data and make sure the bitmaps array contain the resolved data.
It's important that we wait for all promises in parallel and not serially.

I don't need an explanation this time, just give me the code.

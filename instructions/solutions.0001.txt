Given an object with conditions like the following:
    conditions : [
        "velX > 0",
        "age < 100"
    ],
Give me a function called matchesCondition(conditions, lemming), this function should
check whether the property velX is greater than 0 and age is less than 100.
Note that the values checked against are integers. There can be more than
two arguments and there can also be other types of operators.

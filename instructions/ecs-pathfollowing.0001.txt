Given an ECS in JS. I want the System for this PathFollowing component:

class PathFollowing extends Component {
  constructor(path, speed = 1) {
      super();
      this.path = path; // [ { x: 1, y:1, }, ... ]
      this.speed = speed;
      this.currentPoint = 0;
  }
}

Get components like this:
for (const [id, pathFollowing] of Object.entries(components.PathFollowing)) { ... }

Get related components like this:
const position = components.Position[id];

Throw errors when applicable:
- PathFollowing requires Position component
- PathFollowing may not have Velocity component

When reaching the end of the path, it should go to starting point and repeat.
Regardless of distance between points, it should always move at configured speed.

Just give me the update method.

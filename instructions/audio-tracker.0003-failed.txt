>>> Version 5:
Given a datastructure that looks like this:

const song = {
  // Samples are named like this: instrument-octave-note-length(in sec)
  sampleAliases : [
    "PN-4-C-0.25",  // 0
    // etc
  ],
  // Patterns specify which instrument-octave-note-length sample to play when. What is specified
  // here is the index of a sample in sampleAliases (to save space).
  // Patterns should have 64 items, but can have empty indices to indicate that no new audio should start
  patterns: [
    [3,0,1, ...],
    [4,,4,, ...],
    [0,1,2, ...],
    [4,,3,, ...],
  ],

  // A player will iterate over the objects in data, each channel can refer to 0 or more pattern (indices).
  // All 4 channels will play at the same time as they are using different instruments, when all patterns
  // in all channels completed, the player will move to the next object and play that. When the song is 
  // finished, give a console.log() stating so.
  data: [
    {
      // BPM for these patterns being played in the four channels (determines how fast a pattern is played)
      bpm: 60,
      // Refers to indices of the patterns array
      channels: [
        [0, 0, 0 ],  // e.g bass-drum plays here
        [2, 2, 2 ],  // piano here ...
        [null],      // bass here
        [null],      // guitar here
      ],
    },
    {
      // ...another object with different BPM
      tempo: 120,
      channels: [
        [0, 1, 2, 3],
        [1, 1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 2, 2],
        [3, 3, 3, 3],
      ],
    },
  ],
};

The name of the sample PN-4-C-0.25 says what it is:
- PN = piano
- 4 = octave 4
- C = note C
- 0.25 = length in seconds

- Available instruments and their acronym are:
  - PN = piano
  - GU = guitar
  - BG = bass guitar
  - BD = bass drum (note is ignored)
  - HH = high hat (note is ignored)
- You can only use these instruments, nothing else.
- All octaves and notes are available.

I already have a song, don't give me another one.
Give me the code to play this structure using only a web-browser, all samples are already
available. Likewise, this function is there for you to use: playSample("PN-4-C-0.25") to play that sample. 
Do NOT use while(forever) and do NOT use setTimeout() for timing the playing of samples. Use frame-rate,
or setInterval _maybe_.

Give a console.log() every time a pattern is done, and when song is done.

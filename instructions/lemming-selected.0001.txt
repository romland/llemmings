Given a game in javascript, the following give visual feedback on a selected object:
This is done every frame.

  if (this.isSelected) {
    ctx.strokeStyle = "white";
    ctx.strokeRect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
  }

in the object there is the attribute 'this.age' that increases by one every frame.

Now, instead of a boring box drawn around the selected object I want a slowly pulsing 
thick circle, use age for determining size over time.

It should pulse slowly and it should animate in _and_ out (so a simple modulo on age
will not work, you need a bit more)

Give me only the snippet to draw this circle, no other code. And I don't need an
explanation this time.

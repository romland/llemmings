We're making a game. I need to add something.

Given lemmings that looks like this
const Lemming = {
  id: -49152,
  age: 0,
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
  width: 10,
  height: 20,
  velX: 0,
  velY: 0,
  maxVelX: 0.2,
  deadlyVelY: 3.5,
  onGround: false,
  isDead: false,
  update: function() { ... }
  draw: function() { ... }
}

Additionally, the following is already declared in the game:
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");


The lemmings are drawn on the canvas, I want to be able to select them to eventually apply an action
to them, for instance "stop walking". You can add that action, but know that I will add more actions
later. Indicate with a square around the lemming that is currently selected.

It is important that you use the declared things I mentioned above and just give me the code with
minor comments -- be brief, don't explain anything in plain text.

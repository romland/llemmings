Given client-side javascript and this snippet:
    let persisted = {
      currentLevel : 1,
      currentLevelAttempts : 0,
      overallScore : 0,
    }

I want functions for serializing and deserializing the contents of that variable
in local storage. All code should be in aptly named functions.

This time I don't need explanation, just the code.

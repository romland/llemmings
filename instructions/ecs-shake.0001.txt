Given an ECS in JS, below are components and easings already
available.

I need a new component and system that shakes or rumbles
the position/size/rotation of an entity for a second or so,
so that it looks like a brief earthquake.

There should be a possiblity to restart/stop the shaking
using some attribute of the Shake component.

Components:
  Position : Position,
  Velocity : Velocity,
  PathFollowing : PathFollowing,
  Sprite : Sprite,
  Rotate : Rotate,
  Scale : Scale,
  Animation : Animation,
  Follow : Follow,
  AnimatedSprite : AnimatedSprite,

Easings:
    easeInOutSine : easeInOutSine,
    easeInOutCubic : easeInOutCubic,
    easeInOutBounce : easeInOutBounce,
    easeOutBounce : easeOutBounce,
    easeInBack : easeInBack,
    easeOutBack : easeOutBack,
    easeInOutBack : easeInOutBack,
    easeInElastic : easeInElastic,
    easeOutElastic : easeOutElastic,
    linear : linear,
    lerp : lerp,
    lerpAngle : lerpAngle,


Modify a component this way:
  const id = ecs.search("PathFollowing Star");
  ecs.entities[id].components.Transform.rotation += 0.003;

In a previous prompt you gave me this component, which is fine:
    class Shake extends Component {
        constructor(duration = 1, intensity = 10) {
            super();
            this.duration = duration;
            this.intensity = intensity;
            
            this._timer = 0;
            this._stopped = true;

            this._orgPosition = {x:0, y:0};
            this._orgRotate = 0;
            this._orgScale = {x:1,y:1};
        }
    }

A system is defined (e.g.) this way:
  class MovementSystem extends ECS.System { update(dt, components) {} }

In a system, get entity id and components like this:
  for (const [id, shake] of Object.entries(components.Shake)) {

IMPORTANT: A component should not call any functions in any Entity.

When the shake is over, it should be restored to the original state (position, rotation, scale)

This time I don't need an explanation, just give me the code.

Can you give me the code for how the blocker should work?
Remember that the other lemmings should not be able to walk past it, other lemmings should now 
treat the Blocker like an impenetrable wall -- remember to check whether the lemming is on the 
same Y as the blocker too -- you should probably check the entire collision box of the lemming 
instead of a single pixel.
The Blocker itself should stop moving on the X axis.
Only one action can be applied to a lemming.
Deselect the lemming once an action is applied.
Tell me what I need to add to the lemming.update() method too.

>>>> Update to the result of the above:
Update the code, which sits in Lemming.update(), instead of checking only a single pixel on x, it 
should check for two boxes colliding (lemmings),
width, height, x, y, velX, velY are already defined in the object.
// force other lemmings to turn around if they hit the blocker
lemmings.forEach(otherLemming => {
if (otherLemming !== this && !otherLemming.isDead && otherLemming.action === "Blocker") {
    if ((otherLemming.x > this.x && otherLemming.velX > 0) || 
        (otherLemming.x < this.x && otherLemming.velX < 0)) {
    otherLemming.velX *= -1;
    console.log("Ran into a blocker?", this.x, this.y)
    }
}
});
Instead of forEach, use a for(...) loop. Only update the code above.

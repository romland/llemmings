Given javascript and 2D canvas, we're making a game.

I want a system where I draw e.g. a door going from closed to open state
over 30 frames.

I want each frame to be cut out from the temporary canvas and stored in
an array to be replayed at a later stage.

Give me the code to both generate and replay this animation on a canvas context of choice.

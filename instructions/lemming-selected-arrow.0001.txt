This is a sprite in a javascript game using 2d canvas:
    class Lemming
    {
      constructor(x, y) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.width = 10;
        this.height = 20;
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.velX = 0;
        this.velY = 0;
      }
    }

above this sprite, I want to paint a white large arrow (configurable size) 
indicating which direction along x it is currently moving. Attribute velX 
can be positive for right, and negative for left.

Get attributes of the sprite using 'this' and 'ctx' for canvas context.

And sheesh, an arrow looks like this: -> or <-

This time, give me only the code, I don't need an explanation.
